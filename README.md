This project aims to support the creation of a searchable interpretation of my grandfather's (Richard Knowlton West) journal from his time serving a Mormon mission in Germany at the start of World War II.
Some of the difficulties include:
- Working with digital scans from the original document (OCR)
- Writing is in cursive, so base OCR isn't incredibly accurate
- Scans were made from two pages in one image- each page is one or more days, the tendency of the base AI is to read lines as straight across, likely including one or more days in a single 'line'. _This needs to be accommodated for in the image processing._
